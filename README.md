### 12/11/2024
Hi, this is a project  I did using the commonly known "palmerpenguins" data package in RStudio. I created this project to showcase some of the data analysis skills I have been developing in the past few months. 

The "penguins.R" file shows the code I ran in RStudio. The "penguins.Rmd" is the R Markdown file I created to show the outputs of the code and my interpretations of the results. The knit file created from R Markdown is the "penguins.docx" file. This can be viewed without running any code. 

If you run any of this code, the packages listed at the top of the R files need to be installed (install.packages("")) if you haven't done so already.
